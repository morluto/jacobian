# jacobian/reliability-series-path

Compute exact two-terminal network reliability of a small graph.

## Field

graph-theory

- derivation: Series path graph; exact reliability replay.

## Contract

- schema_version: 1.4
- difficulty: medium
- maximum_assurance: COMPUTED
- agent-visible verification record schema: no
- timeout_sec (agent): 600.0
- timeout_sec (verifier): 120.0
- environment_mode: separate

The task is self-contained and offline. The instruction names no tool,
operation, or invocation order. The verifier is a separate clean-room Python
script that scores correctness, evidence validity, scope accuracy, assurance
calibration, and aggregate reward; a wrong result or an unsupported VERIFIED
claim forces the reward to zero.
